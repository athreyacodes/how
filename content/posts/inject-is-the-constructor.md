## Context

I used to open a component, write a constructor, and inject three services as parameters. It worked. It also meant a constructor that did not construct anything. It was just a wiring block.

On a small standalone page, that feels heavy. The route already decided what this page is. The component only needs a couple of tokens, plus whatever the person on the page just changed.

`inject` reads a token at creation time. Same moment a constructor parameter would have been filled in. You can call it in the field initializer. No constructor required.

And if the thing you are holding is UI state — a selected tag, a toggle, a query string you already parsed — a signal is the honest place for it. The template can just read the current value.

## Where this applies

Use this on standalone components and routes that are mostly a view plus a little local state.

Typical cases:

- A list page with a filter chip. The filter is local. It does not belong in a store.
- A note page that already got its post from a resolver. The component should not fetch it again in `ngOnInit`.
- Any component where the constructor would only have assigned `this.foo = foo`.

This is not a ban on constructors. If you need to run logic with several injected values before the first change detection, a constructor is still fine. I just do not start there any more.

Also, `inject` has to run in an injection context. Field initializers on an `inject()`-created class are that context. A random helper function is not, unless you wrap it.

## How

Take what the component needs with `inject`. Keep the field private if the template does not use it.

```ts
export class Home {
  private readonly posts = inject(Posts);
  protected readonly tag = signal<Tag | null>(null);
}
```

`posts` is data. `tag` is the filter the person clicked. Two different jobs, so two different kinds of fields.

Keep UI state in a signal so the template can stay a read of current values. A `computed` list is enough when the filter is local:

```ts
protected readonly list = computed(() => {
  const tag = this.tag();
  return this.posts.all.filter((post) => !tag || post.tags.includes(tag));
});
```

When `tag` is `null`, show everything. When it is `'angular'`, show notes that have that tag. The list updates because it is computed from a signal. No `OnInit`. No manual subscription.

The route already resolved what the page needs. The component only holds what the user just changed.

## Watch out for

Do not call `inject` inside the `computed`. The computed runs later, outside the creation context. Inject once on the class, then read it inside the computed.

Do not mirror the same value in a signal and a plain field. Pick one. If the template needs to react, it is a signal.

And if the data comes from the router, trust the resolver. Fetching the same post again in the component is how you get a flash of empty and two sources of truth.
