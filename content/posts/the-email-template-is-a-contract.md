description: How to version an HTML email template so placeholders, loops, escaping, and i18n stay a stable contract with the sending service.

## **What** was the situation

Once the Enate digest looked right in Outlook, we still had to share it with backend. They were going to merge data into it and send. The first version had cute names: `{{title}}`, `{{name}}`, a comment that said "repeat this tr for each item". Backend guessed. A deploy from front-end renamed a placeholder. Mail went out with literal `{{digestTitle}}` in the header, or worse, with a learner name that had an `&` and broke the markup.

The HTML file is not a mock. It is an API. It needs a schema, escaping rules, and a version, the same way you would not change a REST field on a Friday without telling anyone.

## **When** does this apply

Use this when front-end authors HTML and a Java or Node service sends it.

- Digests with a list of rows whose length only the backend knows.
- Mail that exists in more than one language.
- Any placeholder that might contain a name, a comment, or a URL.

Skip this if the vendor owns the template and you only pass a JSON blob their UI already documents.

## **How** is it done

Name placeholders like fields. Not like copy. Put the contract at the top of the file so it cannot drift into Slack.

```html
<!--
  template: case-digest
  version: 3
  locale: injected as {{locale}}
  required:
    digestTitle, digestLead, openUrl
  each item in items[]:
    itemTitle, itemMeta
-->
```

Backend pins `case-digest@3`. Front-end may add `v4` next to it. Do not edit `v3` in place. Old mail jobs still run.

Loops need an explicit block, not a comment that says "repeat". Handlebars-style is fine if both sides agree. Keep it ugly and obvious:

```html
{{#each items}}
<table role="presentation" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 12px 32px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
      <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 700;">{{itemTitle}}</p>
      <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 14px;">{{itemMeta}}</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
{{/each}}
```

Escaping: backend must HTML-escape every string it did not mark as safe. Names like `O'Neil & sons` will close a tag if you concatenate. Front-end does not `{{{itemTitle}}}` unless the value is a URL you already validated, and even then you escape `&` in query strings.

i18n: do not put English sentences in the template and ask backend to replace "Case" with "Cas". Either the template is per locale (`case-digest.en.html`, `case-digest.fr.html`) or every user-visible string is a placeholder. Mixing both is how one locale ships a half-translated digest.

A fixture JSON lives next to the HTML:

```json
{
  "digestTitle": "Monday handover",
  "digestLead": "3 cases need you.",
  "openUrl": "https://app.example/cases",
  "items": [
    { "itemTitle": "Invoice stuck", "itemMeta": "Assigned to you" }
  ]
}
```

CI renders the fixture into HTML and fails if a placeholder remains. That is the contract test. Front-end can still preview tables in a browser. Backend can still send. Neither side is guessing.

## Watch out for

Do not pass HTML from the product database into a placeholder without a sanitizer. That is how a case title becomes a phishing kit inside a trusted email.

Do not version by filename `digest-final-FINAL.html`. Use `version: N` and keep old N until the last sender job is gone.

And do not put signed photo URLs in digest items. Those expire, get forwarded, and fight the upload note you already wrote.
